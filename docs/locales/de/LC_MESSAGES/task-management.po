"It is possible to terminate any active tasks by clicking the red button. "
"**There is no confirmation step**. Note that this immediately interrupts "
"everything this process was doing so far, leading to things like "
"partially imported studies. In general this should not be an issue (in "
"case of aborted imports they should be completed when you start importing"
" them again), but note that there is a certain risk in killing tasks and "
"use this only as a last resort."

"A note on move: executing a move will create a task which then produces "
