"The final field in the summary at the top is called 'Test patient "
"indicators?' When studies are imported the ID and patient name fields are"
" both ignored, but they are parsed to check if they have 'phy', 'test' or"
" 'qa' in them to help exclude them from the data analysis. If they do, "
"then this information is added to the field and is displayed both in the "
"web interface as a Test patient indicator and in the Excel export. The "
"name and ID themselves are not reproduced, simply the presence of one of "
"the key words. Therefore a patient named 'Phyliss' would trigger this, "
"but only 'Phy' would be reproduced in this field. Other fields will also "
"help to confirm whether a study is for a real patient such as the lack of"
" an Accession Number and an unusual patient age."
