"Previous versions of OpenREM used each X-ray system's DICOM ``station "
"name`` as the identifier for each X-ray system. The front page showed a "
"summary of the number of studies for each unique ``station name`` stored "
"in the system. This led to a problem if multiple X-ray systems used the "
"same station name: the OpenREM home page would only show one station name"
" entry for these systems, with the number of studies corresponding to the"
" total from all the rooms. The name shown alongside the total was that of"
" the system that had most recently sent data to the system."

"OpenREM determines the modality type of a system based on the information"
" in the DICOM radiation dose structured report. However sometimes this "
"mechanism fails because vendors use templates meant for RF also for DX "
"systems. Therefore it is possible from version 0.8.0 to set a modality "
"type for each system manually. A manually set modality type overrides the"
" automatically determined value."

"device. If this UID is received by OpenREM it can set the display name "

"Device Observer UID. This option can be useful if other parameters that "
"OpenREM looks at frequently change. If you want to see if one of the "
