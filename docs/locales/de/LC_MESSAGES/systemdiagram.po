"PostgreSQL is the recommended database to use with OpenREM. It is the "
"only database that OpenREM will calculate median values for charts with. "
"Other databases can be used with varying capabilities; see the `Django "
"documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/databases/>`_ "
"for more details. For testing only, the built-in SQLite3 database can be "
"used, but this is not suitable for later migration to a production "
"database."
