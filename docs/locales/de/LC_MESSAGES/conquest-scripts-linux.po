"Create a bash script for each of RDSR, mammo, DX and Philips CT dose "
"images, as required. They should have content something like the "
"following. The examples that follow assume the files have been saved in "
"the folder ``/etc/conquest-dicom-server`` but you can save them where you"
" like and change the ``dicom.ini`` commands accordingly."

"These scripts have a line in them to activate the virtual environment; "

"Eash script also has a line to delete the object after it has been "
"imported – OpenREM can also do this by configuration, but the file will "
"be written by the ``_conquest`` user, and OpenREM will not be running as "
"that user. Therefore it is easier to have conquest delete the file. If "
"you don't want them to be deleted, remove or comment out that line (add a"
" ``#`` character to the start of the line)."
