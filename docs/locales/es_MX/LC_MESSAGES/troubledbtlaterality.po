"The code for extracting dose related information from Hologic digital "
"breast tomosynthesis proprietary projection images object used an "
"incorrect tag to extract the laterality of the image in releases before "
"0.8.0 in June 2018. As a result the accumulated AGD code didn't work, so "
"the accumulated AGD cell on the mammography summary sheets remained "
"blank."

"Releases between 0.8.0 and 0.10.0 had instructions on how to rectify this"
" for existing studies in the database, but these instructions are not "
"suitable for version 1.0 and later and therefore these instructions have "
