"Mammography is interesting in that all the information required for dose "
"audit is contained in the image header, including patient 'size', ie "
"thickness. However the disadvantage over an RSDR is the requirement to "
"process each individual image rather than a single report for the study, "
"which would also capture any rejected images."
