"The same type of examination can appear in OpenREM under a range of "
"different ``requested procedure names``, ``study descriptions`` or "
"``procedure names``. Individual acquistions of the same type may appear "
"under a range of different ``acquisition protocol names``. The standard "
"name mapping feature allows a number of differently named exams or "
"acquisitions to be grouped into a single standard name, allowing easier "
"analysis of data for audits and diagnostic reference level (DRL) creation"
" (see DRL definition on the IAEA_ website)."

"If the logged in user is an OpenREM adminstrator the ``standard name "
"settings`` option will be available on the ``Config`` drop down menu "
"(figure 1). Clicking on this will take the administrator to the standard "
"name mapping settings page (figure 2). From this page the administrator "
"can enable or disable standard name mapping for the OpenREM installation."
" Enabling standard name mapping causes an additional column to be "
"displayed in each modality summary page where any standard study-level "
"names associated with each entry in the exam table are displayed (figure "
"3), and when viewing the details of an individual study any matching "
"standard acquisition names are displayed in the appropriate table row "
"(figure 4). Enabling standard name mapping also makes the standard study "
"name and standard acquisition name charts available. The administrator "
"can also use the ``standard name settings`` page to access the standard "
"name internal database refresh links. Note that the use of these links is"
" not expected to be necessary in normal OpenREM use."

"be included in the new standard name definition. The available items are "

"Charts of standard name data can be plotted in OpenREM. This can be "
"helpful because at study-level it enables multiple ``study "
"descriptions``, ``requested procedure names`` and ``procedure names`` to "
"be combined into a single data point. At acquisition level, multiple "
"``acquisition protocol names`` can be combined into a single data point. "
"For example, figure 8 below shows the median DLP for a range of ``study "
"descriptions``. Three of the ``study descriptions`` relate to the head, "
"and two of them relate to scans of the chest and abdomen. The three head-"
"related descriptions have been mapped to a ``Head`` standard study name, "
"and the two chest and abdomen descriptions have been mapped to a ``Chest "
"+ Abdomen`` standard study name, resulting in the chart shown in figure "
"9. The standard name mapping allows clearer visual comparison of the data"
" per study for each hospital and piece of equipment."
