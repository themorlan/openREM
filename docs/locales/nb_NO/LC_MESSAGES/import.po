"For production use, you will either need the modalities to send the RDSR "
"or images directly to your OpenREM server using DICOM, or you will need "
"to use query-retrieve to fetch the DICOM objects from the PACS or the "
"modalities. In either of these situations, you will need to run a DICOM "
"Store service on your OpenREM server."

"The DICOM store built in to OpenREM hasn't proved to be stable over the "
"longer term with the current implementation and library that it depends "
"on. This will be rectified in a future version, but for now we recommend "
"you use a third-party DICOM store. Previous releases have recommended the"
" Conquest DICOM server which is very good for this task. However, due to "
"difficulties with installation on some platforms, we are now recommending"
" the Orthanc DICOM server instead:"
