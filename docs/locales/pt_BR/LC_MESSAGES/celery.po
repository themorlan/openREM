"Celery and RabbitMQ were used by OpenREM to run tasks in the background, "
"like exports and DICOM queries. Since release 1.0 OpenREM uses standard "
"python multiprocessing - hence none of those tools is required anymore. "
"RabbitMQ handles the message queue and Celery provides the 'workers'  "
"that perform the tasks."
