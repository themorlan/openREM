"If you have trouble when installing the Python packages on Windows due to"
" incorrect architecture, you may need to either download on a Windows "
"system similar to the server (matching 32-bit/64-bit), or to download the"

"The instructions that follow are for a Windows server that doesn't have "

"access to the distribution's repositories to install and update the "
"software. It is technically possible to use a local repository "
"mirror/cache, or to download all the packages manually, but this is "
"beyond the scope of these instructions."
