"Fluoroscopy studies can now be exported in a format suitable for "

" incidence map can be downloaded from "
"https://bitbucket.org/openskin/openskin/downloads (choose the zip file), "
"and information about the project can be found on the `openSkin wiki`_. "
"The software allows the user to choose between a 2D phantom that would "
"represent the dose to a film laying on the couch surface, or a simple 3D "
"phantom made up of a cuboid and two semi-cylinders (these can be seen on "
"the `Phantom design`_ section of the wiki). For both options the output "
"is an image of the dose distribution in 2D, along with calculated peak "
"skin dose information."

msgid ""
"Prior to version 0.6, the compression force extracted from the "
"mammography image header was divided by ten before being stored in the "
"database. This was because the primary author only had access to GE "
"Senograph DS units, which store the compression force in dN, despite "
"claiming using Newtons in the DICOM conformance statement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../release-0.6.0.rst:80
msgid ""
"The code now checks for the term *senograph ds* contained in the model "
"name. If it matches, then the value is divided by ten. Otherwise, the "
"value is stored without any further change. We know that later GE units, "
"the GE Senograph Essential for example, and other manufacturer's units "
"store this value in N. If you have a case that acts like the Senograph "
"DS, please let us know and we'll try and cater for that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../release-0.6.0.rst:85
msgid ""
"If you have existing non-GE Senograph mammography data in your database, "
"the compression force field for those studies is likely to be incorrect "
"by a factor of ten (it will be too small). Studies imported after the "
"upgrade will be correct. If this is a problem for you, please let us know"
" and we'll see about writing a script to correct the existing data."

"being provided - it is not yet clear if this is a configuration issue."
