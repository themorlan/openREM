msgid "This is the quickest and easiest way of installing a fully functioning OpenREM instance, complete with database, web server and DICOM server, on any operating system that supports Docker with Linux containers. This includes Windows 10 with Docker Desktop, but currently excludes Windows Server, though this may change with availability of WSL2 for Windows Server 2022."

msgid "It is advisable that the server OpenREM is installed on has access to the internet to get images from Docker and security updates for the operating system. However, if this is not possible the Docker images can be obtained on a computer that does have access to the internet and transferred to the 'offline' server for installation."
