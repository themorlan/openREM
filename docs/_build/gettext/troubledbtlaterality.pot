msgid "The code for extracting dose related information from Hologic digital breast tomosynthesis proprietary projection images object used an incorrect tag to extract the laterality of the image. As a result the accumulated AGD code didn't work, so the accumulated AGD cell on the mammography summary sheets remained blank."

msgid "The code below allows the laterality to be derived automatically from the acquisition protocol name, if the protocol name has ``R`` or ``L`` as the first letter. When this information is derived, the accumulated AGD is also calculated per breast."

You will need to edit the ``DISPLAY_NAME`` to match the display name you have configured for the Hologic DBT system that needs to be modified. If you are not sure what this is, go to the home page of your OpenREM installation and see how the Hologic unit is listed there. You will not be able to copy and paste from there as if you click on it it will load that page, and likewise on the summary list page. If you click through to the study detail page, you will find the display name listed in the details there. See the :doc:`i_displaynames` documentation for more information."
