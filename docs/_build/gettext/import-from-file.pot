msgid "This extractor is designed to create a DICOM radiation dose structured report from the information contained in secondary capture dose summary images, supplemented by data stored in image tags. It requires a folder of DICOM objects as input (suitable data can be retrieved from a DICOM node using the ``qrscu.py`` command with the ``-toshiba`` switch - see :ref:`qrcommandlineinterface`). It creates an initial RDSR from the secondary capture dose summary, and then tries to enrich this with additional information contained in image tags. The routine attempts to extract the following information from the image tags and insert it into the initial RDSR:"
