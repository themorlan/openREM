msgid "The DICOM store built in to OpenREM hasn't proved to be stable over the longer term with the current implementation and library that it depends on. This will be rectified in a future version, but for now we recommend you use a third-party DICOM store. Previous releases have recommended the Conquest DICOM server which is very good for this task. However, due to difficulties with installation on some platforms, we are now recommending the Orthanc DICOM server instead:"
