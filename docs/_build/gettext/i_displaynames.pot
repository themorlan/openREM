msgid "Previous versions of OpenREM used each X-ray system's DICOM ``station name`` as the identifier for each X-ray system. The front page showed a summary of the number of studies for each unique ``station name`` stored in the system. This led to a problem if multiple X-ray systems used the same station name: the OpenREM home page would only show one station name entry for these systems, with the number of studies corresponding to the total from all the rooms. The name shown alongside the total was that of the system that had most recently sent data to the system."

#: ../../i_displaynames.rst:39
msgid "OpenREM determines the modality type of a system based on the information in the DICOM radiation dose structured report. However sometimes this mechanism fails because vendors use templates meant for RF also for DX systems. Therefore it is possible from version 0.8.0 to set a modality type for each system manually. A manually set modality type overrides the automatically determined value."

A device can send its Device Observer UID (especially in rdsr-objects). This is a unique ID for the device. If this UID is received by OpenREM it can set the display name and modality type the same as an already known device with the same Device Observer UID. This option can be useful if other parameters that OpenREM looks at frequently change. If you want to see if one of the other parameters changed (like software version), don't tick this option."

In this situation a new entry is created in the display name settings for every new exam that arrives in OpenREM, making the display name table fill with many duplicate entries for the same system. To avoid this problem a list of models can be specified using the variable below - OpenREM will ignore the Device Observer UID value when creating new display names for any model in this list. The model name text must exactly match what is contained in the system's Manufacturer's Model Name DICOM tag (0008,1090)."
