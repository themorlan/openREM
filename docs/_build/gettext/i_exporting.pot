The data from row 2 onwards can be copied and pasted directly into row 150 (152 for paed survey) onwards of the Patient and Protocol sheet of the adult PHE data collection spreadsheet. The adult survey starts in column A, the paediatric survey starts in column B. Column AL (AM for paed survey) is for patient comments, and OpenREM uses this cell to record the series types that have been exported for each study. This can therefore be used to double check the data is as you expect it to be. If the protocol has more than four series excluding localisers, the data is continued in the same format from column AM (AN for paed) onwards."
