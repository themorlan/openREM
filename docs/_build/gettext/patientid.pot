msgid "If you wish to have the patient name and/or ID available for finding studies relating to a specific patient, but do not need to identify who that patient is, then it is possible to create an 'encrypted' version of the ID or name. In this case, a one-way SHA 256 hash is generated and the hash value is stored instead."

msgid "If the IDs or names are encrypted, then these columns will contain the hash rather than the original values. However, it will be possible to see if more than one study belongs to one patient as the values should be the same for both. Due to the nature of the algorithm however, a single change in the name or ID - such as an upper case letter instead of a lower case one - will be recorded as a completely different hash value."
