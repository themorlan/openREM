This can be useful for exporting a clean set of data to process for a dose audit."

msgid "The final field in the summary at the top is called 'Test patient indicators?' When studies are imported the ID and patient name fields are both ignored, but they are parsed to check if they have 'phy', 'test' or 'qa' in them to help exclude them from the data analysis. If they do, then this information is added to the field and is displayed both in the web interface as a Test patient indicator and in the Excel export. The name and ID themselves are not reproduced, simply the presence of one of the key words. Therefore a patient named 'Phyliss' would trigger this, but only 'Phy' would be reproduced in this field. Other fields will also help to confirm whether a study is for a real patient such as the lack of an Accession Number and an unusual patient age."

msgid "The ``Duration`` value is the amount of time that the exposure switch or pedal was pressed (technically, this should be the time from the loading of the first x-ray pulse to the time of the trailing edge of the final pulse for that irradiation event). The ``Exposure time`` value is different: this is the total time that the x-ray beam was actually switched on for during the irradiation event. So for pulsed fluoroscopy the ``Exposure time`` will be (much) shorter than the ``Duration``."
