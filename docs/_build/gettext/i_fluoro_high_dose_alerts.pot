msgid "As well as alerting to individual studies that exceed alert levels the system can be configured to calculate cumulative dose over a defined number of weeks for studies with matching patient IDs. When this is activated, for each study OpenREM looks for earlier fluoroscopy studies that have taken place that share the same patient ID, or encrypted patient ID, and sums the study DAP and total dose at reference point values. The time period that is used is configured by an OpenREM administrator, and defaults to 12 weeks (figure 2). This feature has not yet been implemented for the skin dose."
