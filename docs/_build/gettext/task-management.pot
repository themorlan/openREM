msgid "It is possible to terminate any active tasks by clicking the red button. **There is no confirmation step**. Note that this immediately interrupts everything this process was doing so far, leading to things like partially imported studies. In general this should not be an issue (in case of aborted imports they should be completed when you start importing them again), but note that there is a certain risk in killing tasks and use this only as a last resort."

This limit can be altered by users who are logged in with admin rights by clicking on **Task settings** in the **Config** menu and changing the current value. If this limit is set to a very high value it can cause the web browser to run out of memory when trying to view the **Task** page due to the large number of rows in the tables."
