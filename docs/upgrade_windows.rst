**********************************
Upgrading a native Windows install
**********************************

Release 1.0 of OpenREM uses a newer version of Python and no longer uses RabbitMQ, Erlang and Celery.

Consider upgrading to a new Windows server instead of upgrading in place.

* something about a clean install, and/or not having old services that are no longer required
* something about being a standardised approach which will make upgrade docs and examples easier to follow

Then best effort upgrade docs...
