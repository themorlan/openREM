So what we need is as follows:
- checking the CTDIvol values of each series against the national german DRL
- generating alerts for the following conditions:
a) CTDIvol of a single series exceeds 80 mGy for body series (Abdomen, Pelvis, Cardio, CAP, Chest, and so on).
b) CTIDvol of a single series exceeds 120 mGy for a head series (CCT, CCTA, facial bone and so on)
For a) and b) ere we could use the DICOM tag body part
c) if CTDIvol of one series is greater than 300% of the reference DRL, then calculate the average of the last 20 exams with the same series/study description on the same scanner. 
 If this is greater than 200% of the reference DRL, then generate an alert and send an email.
